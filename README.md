# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains a collection of sample web pages that I created using HTML and CSS.

## Projects
- Love, Dog Site
- Movie Theater Site

### Love, Dog Site
This page is a representation of a dog adoption agency. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site
This page represents a home page for a movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components but
not limited to a navbar, Jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
